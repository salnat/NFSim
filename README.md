NeuroFeedback Simulator for Prof Tami Bar Shalita's lab

This repositry contains a python gui that simulates the work of An EEG based neurofeedback training
where it simulates a stream of data from the EEG recording electrodes that alters the state of 
a picture; blurring and size.
In a real Neurofeedback session, the patient would try to make the picture clearer and bigger by concentrating and 
"controling" his brain activity.

What is Neurofeedback ?

Neurofeedback, also called neurotherapy or neurobiofeedback, is a type of biofeedback that uses real-time displays of brain activity—most commonly electroencephalography (EEG)—in an attempt to teach self-regulation of brain function. Typically, sensors are placed on the scalp to measure electrical activity, with measurements displayed using video displays or sound. It is mostly known as a complementary and alternative treatment of many brain dysfunctions.
